# buildOpenCVTX1
Build and install OpenCV for the NVIDIA Jetson TX1

These scripts build OpenCV version 3.4 for the NVIDIA Jetson TX1 Development Kit. Please see Releases/Tags for earlier versions.

OpenCV is a rich environment which can be configured in many different ways. You should configure OpenCV for your needs, by modifying the build file "buildOpenCV.sh". Note that selecting different options in OpenCV may also have additional library requirements which are not included in these scripts. Please read the notes below for other important points before installing.

The Jetson does not have enough disk space to build a full configuration on the eMMC. The easiest method to build is to place the OpenCV source directory on external media such as a SD card, a USB flash drive or SATA drive.

The buildOpenCV script has two optional command line parameters:

<ul>
<li>-s | --sourcedir   Directory in which to place the opencv sources (default $HOME)</li>
<li>-i | --installdir  Directory in which to install opencv libraries (default /usr/local)</li>
</ul>

To run the the build file:

$ ./buildOpenCV.sh -s &lt;file directory&gt;

This will build OpenCV is the given file directory and install OpenCV is the /usr/local directory.

The folder ~/opencv and ~/opencv_extras contain the source, build and extra data files. If you wish to remove them after installation, a convenience script is provided:

$ ./removeOpenCVSources.sh -d &lt;file directory&gt;

where the &lt;file directory&gt; contains the OpenCV source.

## Notes
There may be issues if different version of OpenCV are installed. JetPack normally installs OpenCV in the /usr folder. You will need to consider if this is appropriate for your application. It is important to realize that many packages may rely on OpenCV. The standard installation by JetPack places the OpenCV libraries in the /usr directory. 

You may consider removing OpenCV installed by JetPack before performing this script installation:

$ sudo apt-get purge libopencv*

With this script release, the script now installs OpenCV in /usr/local. Earlier versions of this script installed in /usr. You may have to set your include and libraries and/or PYTHONPATH to point to the new version. See the Examples folder. Alternatively, you may want to change the script to install into the /usr directory.

The Jetson is an aarch64 machine, which means that the OpenCV configuration variable ENABLE_NEON is ignored. The compiler includes NEON support for all machines with aarch64 architecture.

These scripts rely on OpenCV finding the correct CUDA version, instead of setting it manually.

Special thanks to Daniel (Github user @dkoguciuk) for script cleanup.
